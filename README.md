# Adventurer Journey
You are an adventurer trying to navigate to a destination using specific directional instructions. Adventurer Journey will run your instructions and determine the distance from your destination to the starting point as the crow flies. 

## Running The Program
You must have python installed on your local machine, then clone this repository down. 

### Windows
1. Navigate to your local repository with File Explorer or from the command line.
2. Either double click run.bat from File Explorer or run .\run.bat in Powershell

### Mac OS/Unix
1. Navigate to your local repository from a bash terminal
2. Run ./run.sh from the command line.

## Inputting Directions
The directional input is a sequence of instructions, with each instruction containing a number of steps followed by the direction.

The possible directions are:
- F to go forward/north
- B to go backward/south
- R to go right/east
- L to go left/west

The instructions are formatted into a single string with no whitespace or separators.

### Example
`15F6B6B5L`

1. 15 steps forward (15F)
2. 6 steps back (6B)
3. 6 steps back (6B)
4. 5 steps left (5L)

Which will return:
`You are 5.830951894845301 steps from your starting point!`

# Adventurer Journey - Back End
Please complete the story below and create a program to solve the problem. Commit any work back to the remote no later than 48 hours before the next interview.

*Please use whatever languages, references and tooling you would like to complete the story.*

## Story Instructions
You are an adventurer standing in the center of a map facing North, and youâ€™re trying to weave through the terrain to your final destination. You have the directions to your destination indicating the number of steps and the direction to travel.

Adventurer Path & Instructions - [./Adventurer Path.md](./Adventurer%20Path.md)

Given the Path Instructions above, programmatically parse the instructions and determine what is the Euclidean (straight line) distance from your starting point to the destination in steps?

**Tech Notes:**
- Use whatever languages, references and tooling you would like.
- Provide any needed instructions to run program.
- Do not round to the nearest step.
- After program executes the answer should be returned.
